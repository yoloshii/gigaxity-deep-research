# Release notes

## v0.2.0 (2026-05-18)

Closes 4 turns of adversarial code review by codex GPT-5.5 high (session `019e395a-8fe7-7e00-ad24-05e20fdb2e1a`, cleared with verbatim "zero remaining findings"). The synthesis pipeline gained two new safety contracts and several latent bug-fixes that affect MCP `synthesize` callers.

### Behavior changes operators will hit

The MCP `synthesize` tool's `style` parameter default changed from `"comprehensive"` to `None`. When `style` is omitted and a `preset` is provided, the preset's own style now wins (`contracrow` → COMPARATIVE, `academic` → ACADEMIC). Previously `style` defaulted to the string `"comprehensive"`, which silently overrode every preset's intended style. The documented call shape `synthesize(query, sources, preset)` was always taking the wrong style. Callers that pass `style` explicitly are unaffected.

The pre-synthesis relevance gate now short-circuits on REJECT and on PARTIAL with zero passed sources. Previously REJECT silently fell through and synthesis ran over all original sources; PARTIAL with empty `good_sources` fell back to all original sources too. Both cases now return a `## Source quality insufficient` block without invoking the synthesizer. Output is not cached; re-call with better sources rather than retrying the same set. The REST `/synthesize/enhanced` and `/synthesize/p1` routes mirror this behavior.

The post-synthesis verifier gained an entity-coverage check. When the synthesis discusses entities from the query that are absent from every retained source, the verifier hard-fails the output. Exception: if the synthesis frames the gap in the same sentence as the uncovered entity ("we have no source available for X", "not in the gathered sources", "could not find", etc.), the verifier downgrades to a soft warning. This catches the hallucination class where the gate filters all sources for one named entity and the LLM writes about it anyway from prior knowledge.

### Per-preset gate config

`SynthesisPreset` gained three optional fields: `quality_gate_reject_threshold`, `quality_gate_pass_threshold`, and `quality_gate_entity_balanced`. The `comprehensive` and `contracrow` presets relax thresholds to 0.2 / 0.4 (from class defaults 0.3 / 0.5) and enable entity-balanced promotion. Multi-vendor comparison queries scored at ~0.4 under the scalar relevance scorer, so the old thresholds rejected legitimate per-vendor sources. Other presets keep class defaults.

Entity-balanced promotion: when the gate filters sources from a multi-entity comparison query, the gate promotes the highest-centrality rejected source per uncovered entity. Centrality favors title matches (3.0) over body density (1.0 base + 0.5 per additional mention, capped at 3.0). Promotion threshold is `>= 2.0`, so one-off incidental mentions do not promote. `apply_overrides()` preserves the new fields.

### Internals

The LLM source-scoring window expanded from 300 to 1500 chars; the prior cap silently truncated relevant evidence in longer sources. Entity matching uses token-boundary regex throughout (so `Exa` no longer matches `example`). The query-entity extractor handles four shapes: capitalized words, lowercase-with-internal-caps (`vLLM`, `iOS`), hyphenated identifiers (`gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5`), and dotted module paths (`llama.cpp`). Single-word lowercase tools (`bun`, `npm`) remain undetected; callers needing precision should pass entities out-of-band.

### Tests

43 regression tests added in `tests/test_codex_t1_fixes.py` covering the new contracts and bug-fixes. Full sweep: 100 passing, 7 skipped (LLM-required, unchanged from prior baseline).

### Migration notes

No required code changes for existing callers. Two behavior shifts worth knowing:

- Callers that omit `style` and pass a `preset` will see the preset's intended style applied (this was the documented behavior all along; previously a bug). If you relied on the silent default override, pass `style="comprehensive"` explicitly.
- Callers that previously got partial synthesis output over gate-rejected sources will now see a `## Source quality insufficient` response instead. Treat as signal: gather better sources, then re-call.
